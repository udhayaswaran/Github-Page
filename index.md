### SHOE DOG: A MEMOIR BY THE CREATOR OF NIKE | *Phil Knight*
> ***The Oregon Trail: the cowards never started, the weak died along the way. That leaves you and me.***
> - Bill Bowerman, Track Coach of Phil Knight and Nike Co-founder

In this memoir, Phil Knight writes about the narrative of Nike and his search of identity, both of which are inextricably intertwined. After graduating from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Knight is left existentially wondering what he wants to do in his life. His peers have gone on to Investment Banking and other professional, traditional roles you may find a Stanford MBA in. Knight and his friend eventually take a trip around the world because Knight is convinced that this may be his last opportunity to travel the world. First stop: Hawaii. Swooning over its beauty and the lifestyle that comes with living in it, he finds himself a job there. First as an encyclopedia salesman and later as a mutual funds broker. With literally no success in the former and a lack of satisfaction in the latter, he decides to move on to Japan. Here, he pretends to be a US businessman so as to meet with Onitsuka Tiger's people. Onitsuka Tiger had been and is still largely a shoe manufacturing giant from Japan. Keenly aware of the different style of business and meticulous in creating an illusion of confidence, Knight appears credible to Onitsuka Tiger who chooses him to represent them in the American Market. Onitsuka Tiger promises him a sample. Fast forward past his travel around India, Greece, and the rest of the world and a year later, the shoes finally arrive. He initially started selling Tigers out of the trunk of his Plymouth Valiant and though they weren't too shabby, the Tigers still had long ways to go before being widely adopted in America. Reflexively, Knight decides that his track coach at the University of Oregon, Bill Bowerman, would be a vital resource if he were to seriously pursue this shoe selling dilemma. Bowerman and Knight go on a 50/50 split, soon to be changed to a 49/51 split due to Bowerman's trust in Knight. In the years to come, Knight begins to recruit CPAs and people out of law school because, as Knight considered them, they had proven their ability to master a difficult subject and because there was no such thing as "Shoe University" for him to recruit from. Knight's story henceforth becomes a whirlwind of litigation and equity-driven problems. His manufacturer in Japan is largely unimpressed with his exploding sales and seeks other vendors than Blue Ribbon Sports, Knight's company at the time. Knight also lives paycheck to paycheck, unsure of how Blue Ribbon is going to make each payroll.

> ***When you’re an entrepreneur every day is a crisis and every Friday (come payroll) is a Jesus crisis***

Years after, his business ties with Japan are loosened and the manufacturing of his shoes becomes a more global affair. Eventually, Blue Ribbon Sports becomes an entity that has no ties to Onitsuka Tiger and begins to manufacture its own shoes -- Nikes. It is at this cusp in Blue Ribbon Sports's business life that creativity and quality begin to become a personal affair, not just sales. Nikes slowly gains traction in the US market with its endorsements of promising athletes. The first Nike athletes are great but not the best, but destined to be the best because of their attitude and work ethic -- a spirit that epitomizes Knight. Just as soon as it seems like one large financial or legal trouble has ended, another one arises. And with each cycle of growth, Nike is constantly finding itself at the mercy of its creditors. Knight continues to firmly believe that the growth of Nike was more important than the equity that his numerous Banks and lenders had fetishized. 

> ***'Equity...' — it wasn’t a real word— it was bureaucratic jargon. A euphemism for cold hard cash, of which I had none. Purposely.***

Soon, Nike proves itself as a household name that Adidas had to reckon with. What began to distinguish Nike was its innovation and its people. Both Nike athletes and workers had caught this contagious conviction of Bowerman and Knight that running could make America and the world better and that Nikes could make this happen. Nike eventually goes public, issuing both Class A and Class B shares, so Knight is able to retain control and not dilute his stake as much would otherwise be needed in raising money. With each year, Nike commits itself to recruit the most ambitious and budding athletes, striking lifelong endorsements and relations with its athletes in an unparalleled fashion. This, along with its quality-driven production helps it eventually become the shoe, apparel and cultural behemoth that it is today. 

This was my second reading of Shoe Dog and Knight's voice in his writing has not lost a single ounce of charm or conviction since the first time I read Shoe Dog. Shoe Dog is my favorite business book and memoir, and perhaps favorite book of all time. It isn't laden with self-promotion or romanticization of the author's capabilities. Instead, it is filled with harsh, brutal failure and the fight to keep pushing.

> ***Sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something
else — is genius. Giving up doesn’t mean stopping. Don’t ever stop.***

The book is inspirational, tremendously well-written and is void of any pretension you may expect from a Billionaire founder of a Fortune 500 Company. I wish Knight spent more time on the numbers though, to paint a more detailed picture on how Blue Ribbon Sports and Nike were doing financially across the years. I also wish he has talked about what goes into manufacturing and what exactly in the '80s and '90s defined its success today. 

**The main point I take away from Shoe Dog is that conviction and attitude are unstoppable forces of nature that are necessary for success in business.**

> ***Beating the competition is relatively easy. Beating yourself is a never-ending commitment.***
