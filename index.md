### SHOE DOG: A MEMOIR BY THE CREATOR OF NIKE | *Phil Knight*
> ***The Oregon Trail: the cowards never started, the weak died along the way. That leaves you and me.***
> - Bill Bowerman, Track Coach of Phil Knight and Nike Co-founder

In this memoir, Phil Knight writes about the narrative of Nike and the one of his search of being, which inextricably go hand-in-hand. After graduating from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Knight is left existentially wondering what he wants to do in his life. His peers have gone on to Investment Banking and other professional, traditional roles you may find a Stanford MBA in. Knight and his friend eventually take a trip around the world because Knight is convinced that the timing between graduting and starting a job may prove timely for a finding-yourself trip such as this. First stop: Hawaii. With his appreciation of its beauty and newfound sense of joy in Hawaii, he finds himself a job there. First as a encyclopedia seller, then doing the same with mutual funds. With literally no success in the former and a lack of satisfaction in the latter, he decides to move on to Japan, and later to the rest of the world.
